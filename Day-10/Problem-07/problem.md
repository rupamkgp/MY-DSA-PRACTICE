# 443. String Compression

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
- If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.
- Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
